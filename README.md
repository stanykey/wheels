# Wheels

---
This is my little C++ utility library where I usually :
- try to re-invent the wheels to get a better understanding of how it works
- implement things I've watched/heard at some meetings/events/videos
- try to meet the [CppCoreGuidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) requirements
- last but not least, take the fun with C++
